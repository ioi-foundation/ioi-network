# ZK Light Clients

This directory contains implementations of `LightClient` backed by Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

## The ZK Interface Contract

The `ethereum-zk` feature enables a bridgeless verification path for Ethereum state.

### Verification Logic

The system relies on the `IbcZkVerifier` trait. In production, this trait is implemented by a driver that verifies real Groth16 or Plonk proofs (e.g., generated by Succinct SP1).

**Current Simulation Semantics:**
For testing and development without heavy ZK proving overhead, the `SimulatedGroth16` backend is used. This enforces the following invariant:

> `verify(proof, public_inputs)` returns `true` **if and only if** `sha256(proof) == public_inputs`.

This means:
1.  **Headers**: The `update_ssz` (proof bytes) must hash to the `state_root` claimed in the header.
2.  **Inclusion**: The `proof_bytes` for a key-value pair must hash to the trusted `state_root`.

To swap in a real verifier, replace the `SimulatedGroth16` backend in `zk-driver-succinct` with the actual verifier logic, maintaining the `IbcZkVerifier` interface.
