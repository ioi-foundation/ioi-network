//! # IOI Sovereign Context Substrate (SCS)
//!
//! The SCS is the "Brain" of an IOI Agent. It is a verifiable, append-only
//! storage engine derived from the Memvid format (`.mv2`), adapted for the
//! rigorous security requirements of the Internet of Intelligence.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! *   **Verifiable Memory:** Uses `mHNSW` (Merkelized Hierarchical Navigable
//!     Small World) indices to provide cryptographic "Proof of Retrieval."
//!     An agent cannot "lie by omission" about what it remembers.
//!
//! *   **Time-Travel Debugging:** Stores a linear timeline of "Frames"
//!     (Observations + Actions), allowing deterministic replay and debugging
//!     of agent behavior at any block height.
//!
//! *   **Privacy-First:** Supports "Scrub-on-Export." Data is stored raw locally
//!     but rigorously redacted via the Semantic Firewall before leaving the
//!     user's device.
//!
//! *   **Zero-Copy Access:** Designed for memory-mapped I/O, allowing
//!     instantaneous loading of massive context windows into the Workload container.
