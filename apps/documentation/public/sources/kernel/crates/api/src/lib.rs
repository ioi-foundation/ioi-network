//! code to promote robust error handling.

/// Defines the core `ConsensusEngine` trait for pluggable consensus algorithms.
pub mod consensus;
/// Defines unified traits for cryptographic primitives.
pub mod crypto;
/// Re-exports all core error types from the central `ioi-types` crate.
pub mod error;
/// Defines traits for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).
pub mod ibc;
/// Defines the `CredentialsView` trait for decoupled identity lookups.
pub mod identity;
/// Defines traits for services that hook into the block processing lifecycle.
pub mod lifecycle;
/// Traits for pluggable, upgradable blockchain services.
