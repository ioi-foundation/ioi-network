// Path: crates/types/src/app/penalties.rs

//! Defines the canonical, fact-based data structures for reporting and penalizing
//! misbehavior within the system.
//!
//! This module adheres to the principle of "Fact-Based Evidence", where replay
//! protection is based on the immutable facts of an offense, not the specific
//! proof provided. This makes the system robust against attacks that use
//! alternative but equally valid proofs for the same underlying incident.
